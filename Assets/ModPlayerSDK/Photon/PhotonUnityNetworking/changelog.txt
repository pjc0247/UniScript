PUN 2 Change Log

v2.7 (13. February 2019)
Fixed: Offline mode. Custom properties are now set properly.
Renamed: PhotonNetwork.BackgroundTimeout is now PhotonNetwork.KeepAliveInBackground.
Fixed: PhotonNetwork.KeepAliveInBackground now sets the ConnectionHandler.KeepAliveInBackground, which actually affects the background keep-alive.
Fixed: A crash problem on Nintendo Switch. Setting a Thread.Name caused a crash in some Unity exports. We work around this by simply not naming internal threads.
Updated: Photon3Unity3d.dll library to 4.1.2.9, rev4985.
Photon Chat:
    Added: Client API for Max Subscribers and Publish Subscribers features inside public channels.


v2.6 (25th January 2019)
Fixed: Offline custom properties are now set even if ExpectedProperties is set, as there is only one source for setting properties when in offline mode. 
Fixed: Switching Offline mode off now properly cleans up room content.
Fixed: Infinite for-loop when enabling all Interest Groups by using new byte[0] as parameter for the SetInterestGroups function.
Fixed: The PhotonView attribute AddComponentMenu could not have a shortcut (in 2018.3) for unknown reasons. It was causing compile errors in some cases, so the shortcut (&v) is gone.
Fixed: Rpc list was not showing in the ServerSettings Inspector.
Fixed: Inspector for ServerSettings no longer closes due to recompile.
Added: Tooltips for all fields in the Photon Server Settings. Each entry is now at least somewhat explained. More in the docs.
Changed: PhotonNetwork.WebRPC can set AuthCookie webflag, which is used for WebHooks.
Changed: PhotonNetwork.CurrentLobby and LoadBalancingClient.CurrentLobby are now readonly. The lobby must be defined by joining one or via the parameter when creating rooms. As before: You don't have to join a lobby to do matchmaking via a lobby.
Changed: SupportLogger now makes use of the new ServerIpAddress value in the PhotonPeer.
Changed: Added a local timestamp to the SupportLogger: it now logs [Time.unscaledTime] in front of each log.
Changed: SupportLogger will also log the "basics" when it got the RegionsList from the Name Server (and it now logs the NS IP-address).
Changed: The log output when Join/Create failed. Now it also logs the State (which is the primary value for IsConnectedAndReady). Better for debugging.
Changed: PhotonNetwork.time is now cached per frame (based on Unity's frameCount value). This applies the same time-value for the whole frame, no matter when Update() gets called on a specific object. This might avoid some judder when syncing objects.
Changed: The property "timestamp" is obsolete (as name) in PhotonMessageInfo. There is now a SentServerTimestamp integer and a SentServerTime double. It makes sense to use the integer to calculate delta-times in milliseconds.
Added: Callback OnDisconnected() to connection-exception handling for "Exception in Receive". Also for: "Max CCU Reached" (probably not used).
Added: Note in reference doc, that "Exception" for receive is typical if you connect a local Photon on Windows but the server isn't running/available.
Fixed: SetInterestGroup() for Offline mode. If offline, it can simply skip the call to OpChangeGroups and avoid some log spamming.
Added: ServerSettings now let you open the dashboard directly for each types of ids, and let you open the whiteList region editor as well.
Fixed: PhotonEditorUtils.IsPrefab() is fixed for 2018.3 onwards, it now takes in consideration both assets and prefab editing stage when checking.
Changed: Setting PhotonNetwork.PrefabPool to null now logs a warning and default to the DefaultPool class.
Fixed: Problems with "Best Region" selection on Nintendo Switch. Best Region now works, even if all available Photon Cloud regions need to be pinged.
Internal: PingMono class now keeps one Socket instance until discarded.
Internal: PingMono uses Socket.Poll() now, instead of .Available (which might also be the cause why this is Switch compatible now).
Internal: PUN now sends PhotonView-updates via a re-used List<object>. A second list was added to the PhotonView, so they can be used alternating and without copying values before sending them.
Changed: ExecuteRpc() to not always create argument- and argument-type-list. This is a minor optimization.
Changed: ExecuteRpc() check of arguments versus a method's parameters.
Changed: RPC() to re-use the event-content Hashtable (and clear it instead of re-creating it every time).
Updated: Photon3Unity3d.dll library to rev4954.

v2.5 (20th November 2018)
Fixed: The RoomOption CleanupCacheOnLeave is now correctly set per room (if set for creation of the room). This bug caused a server-side cleanup of Instantiate-events, buffered RPCs and other buffered events, despite a different setting in the options. This messed with a game's state, if you wanted to keep networked objects when players leave.
Fixed: Regression during PhotoView cleanup leading to loss of viewId in OnDisable and OnDestroy calls. Now OnDisable and OnDestroy can access the viewID. Pooling the game object will set the new viewID before OnEnable is called.
Fixed: Asteroids Demo. The cached room list now gets cleared correctly when the client joins a room / leaves the lobby.
Added: The component "PhotonTransformViewClassic", which provides all the options (and implementation) from PUN Classic (1.xy). Use this if you want to use the options that were previously available. This component is deliberately not used by default.
Changed: The inspector for PhotonTransformView to hint about the PhotonTransformViewClassic and using your own synchronization in general.
Changed: PUN now suppresses the compiler warning "649" on newer versions of Unity for some of our Basics Tutorial scripts. This helps us keep the used code simple and better at "teaching" PUN.
Changed: The Realtime API no longer sends the actor properties on a rejoin. The values are known to the server and should not be updated. Set new values after rejoining the room, if that's needed.
Fixed: Support for 2018.3 and newer prefab workflow to not show/deal the viewId field when editing a prefab.
Fixed: ViewID assignment algorithm when reaching the max view ID value.
Fixed: Removed harmless "duplicate"-warnig inside the DemoHub context. Now eventSystem is only created if needed.

v2.4 (24th October 2018)
Fixed: Duplicated Instantiation Events when using PhotonNetwork.ReconnectAndRejoin: when a client rejoins a room, his server-side cached Instantiation Events get duplicated, resulting in duplicated objects. This has been fixed.
Changed: When Unity exports with Runtime 4.x and Mono, PUN and Chat now use a new, async socket class to work around issues with Socket.Receive blocking indefinitely (and timing out). This is now available for UDP and TCP. IL2CPP is not using this.
Note: We changed the "productname" internally from PhotonUnityNetworking to PUN2, to avoid a problem when building UWP apps with the AssemblyDefinitions in place. In that case, two .dbg files were created and put into the generated solution. This does not affect projects which import PUN (without the ProjectSettings file) but you should keep this in mind.
Updated: The Photon3Unity3d.dll to v4.1.2.4 with some fixes and improvements. See release_history.txt.

v2.3.1 (17th October 2018)
Updated: The Photon3Unity3d.dll to v4.1.2.3 for fix one issue with duplicates of fragmented messages. This could cause an exception and disconnect.

v2.3 (16th October 2018)
Fixed: The "Background Fallback Thread". PhotonHandler.Awake() now starts the fallback thread which send acks, even if the Main Loop is paused. This was missing and potentially causing timeouts when loading levels.
Changed: The Background Fallback Thread will keep a connection for another 30 seconds. This is set via ConnectionHandler.KeepAliveInBackground.
Moved: Instantiation will now call SendInstantiate() earlier to makes sure the event to instantiate is sent (queued) before anything related to the new PhotonViews. This fixes issues when calling an RPC right within Awake() of a new object.
Added: Check in Instantiate, if the prefab has a PhotonView. Logs error and returns null, if it doesn't have one.
Removed: Surplus warning logged when the lower-level connection reports a Disconnected state more than once.
Fixed: When using the 4.x mono runtime in Unity, the Socket.Receive method could get stuck and cause timeouts (in Editor and builds). The LoadBalancingClient now works around this by using the SocketUdpAsync class from our Photon dll in those cases. Please report if there are network-issues with 4.x runtime, mono.
Changed: Enum DisconnectCause. Replace TimeoutDisconnect with ClientTimeout. Replace DisconnectByServer with ServerTimeout. Replace DisconnectByServerUserLimit with MaxCcuReached.
Added: Enum DisconnectCause.DisconnectByServerReasonUnknown for the case it's neither a ccu-limit, timeout nor a disconnect by the room's logic.
Changed: Warning-dialog "AppId not set" is not shown, if the configuration points to a Master Server (Photon OnPremise). When the new server SDK expects an AppId, too, this could be reverted.
Updated: Cockpit demo scene to expose automaticallySyncLevel and load level form. Updated links to docs.
Updated: The readme.txt.
Updated: The Photon3Unity3d.dll to v4.1.2.2, which has a few changes. See release_history.txt.

v2.2  (27th September 2018)
Added: Assembly Definitions for Unity 2017.3 and up. PUN, Realtime, Chat, the WebSocket folder and some Editor classes are now assemblies and will recompile less frequently.
Added: Chat Demo. An updated version of the UI from PUN Classic.
Fixed: PunCockpit integration fixed, scene camera was not set properly. This fixes the black screen over any demo which uses the cockpit.
Fixed: OnCustomAuthenticationFailed() was not virtual in MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks. Now it is and you can override it.
Changed: Custom editor for PhotonServerSettings, which hides AppIdVoice and AppIdChat when the APIs are not present in a project.
Removed: PhotonNetwork.InstantiateInRoomOnly. If you need to instantiate game objects before getting into a room, assign a PhotonView and PhotonView.viewID, when you arrive in a room.

v2.1  (13th September 2018)
Fixed: PunTurnManager fully ported to the new PUN 2 API.
Fixed: SlotRacer Player Control was not setup properly when joining late.
Fixed: Room is now properly cleaned up when unwanted disconnection occurs.
Fixed: WebGL exports can also use the new serialization protocol v1.8. Clients no longer have to set this manually when mixing WebGL and other exports for cross platform games.
Fixed: Before calling OnPhotonSerializeView on observed scripts, each PhotonView checks the component's isActiveAndEnabled. This better matches previous logic, where inactive objects are not running.
Changed: Internals of PhotonNetwork.Instantiate and .Destroy. The process is streamlined and always uses a PrefabPool. The DefaultPool works as before: It loads Resources and actually Destroys them. A custom pool may actually reuse objects and doesn't have to load prefabs from Resources.
Added: DefaultPool class, which is a simple remake of the previous workflow with prefabs and resources.
Changed: The LevelPrefix is now a byte value. It was a short, even though PUN always just sent a byte. It's not changed otherwise and pending an overhault to become more usable.
Changed: AllocateViewId() and AllocateSceneViewId() now have a PhotonView as parameter. This allocates the viewId and applies it right away. Due to that, we no longer need a workaround for "allocated but not yet used" viewIds.
Removed: PhotonNetwork.ObjectPool value. Use PrefabPool to set a new pool.
Removed: UnAllocateViewID(). You no longer have to return any viewIDs, not even manually allocated ones.
Changed: SendInstantiate and ServerCleanInstantiateAndDestroy (called by an object's Destroy) now reuse their Hashtables for the events and the RaiseEventOptions. This reduces GC.
Changed: Internally, PUN stores which prefabs don't implement IPunInstantiateMagicCallback. This avoids calling GetComponents more than once in best case.
Changed: The Asteroids demo caches a list of available rooms now.

v2.0.1  (4th September 2018)
Updated: Asteroids Demo. Fixed room listing, player listing, the ready-button and the countdown for ship instantiation.
Added: A "teleport" setting to the PhotonRigidbody2DView and PhotonRigidbodyView. With this, you can implement teleporting as done in the Asteroids Demo.
Changed: When the PhotonServerSettings point to a Master Server, ConnectUsingSettings() will re-set the serialization protocol (SerializationProtocolType) to be compatible with the Photon Server SDK.

v2.0  (7th August 2018)
Updated: PUN! Cleaned up naming, callbacks, APIs and demos.
Note: We are redoing the docs online: https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/v2
